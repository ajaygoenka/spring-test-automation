Open-ended accounts are those requiring payment of the full balance each month, such as an American Express charge card account. The extent of a person's credit usage is one of the most important factors considered by a FICO® Score. People who keep their ratio of balances to credit limits lower are generally considered less risky to lenders than those with higher ratios. Note, consolidating or moving debt from one account to another will usually not change the total amount owed."

              "explanation": "The presence of a serious delinquency or derogatory indicator is a highly correlated predictor of future payment risk. People with previous late payments are more likely to pay late in the future. As these items age, they will have less impact on the FICO® Score. Most late payments stay on your report for no more than seven years."

              "explanation": "The FICO® Score evaluates balances in relation to available credit on revolving accounts In older versions of the FICO® Score (versions prior to FICO® Score 8), open-ended accounts may be included in this calculation. Open-ended accounts are those requiring payment of the full balance each month, such as an American Express charge card account. The extent of a person's credit usage is one of the most important factors considered by a FICO® Score. People who keep their ratio of balances to credit limits lower are generally considered less risky to lenders than those with higher ratios. Note, consolidating or moving debt from one account to another will usually not change the total amount owed."

              "explanation": "The presence of missed and late payments or derogatory indicators on a credit report, including the number of late payments, how late they were and how recently they occurred, are correlated with future credit risk. Your FICO® Score was lowered due to the number of missed and late payments and/or accounts with derogatory indicators reported. As the number of accounts with delinquency or derogatory indicators decreases, they have less impact on a FICO® Score."

              "explanation": "Missed payments and derogatory indicators , including the number of, how late they were and how recently they occurred, are an important part of a credit report considered by a FICO® Score. People who are current on their payments, have no derogatory indicators and who consistently make payments on time are generally considered less risky by most lenders. As missed payments and accounts with derogatory indicators age, they have less impact on a FICO® Score."
